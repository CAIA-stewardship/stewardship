Interoperability Under CAIA
Non-Normative Draft
=========================================================

STATUS
------
This document is an exploratory, non-normative discussion of what
interoperability means in the context of the CAIA specification.

It does not define requirements, tests, or certification criteria.

---------------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
---------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this document is to clarify how independently developed
CAIA-conformant systems are expected to interoperate in practice.

This document exists to reduce ambiguity, not to impose rules.

---------------------------------------------------------
2. WHAT INTEROPERABILITY IS
---------------------------------------------------------

Under CAIA, interoperability refers to the ability of independently
implemented components to:

- Discover each other where applicable
- Exchange information using CAIA-defined structures
- Coordinate behavior without prior bilateral agreement

Interoperability does not imply identical behavior or feature parity.

---------------------------------------------------------
3. WHAT INTEROPERABILITY IS NOT
---------------------------------------------------------

Interoperability does NOT require:
- Identical user interfaces
- Identical internal architectures
- Shared codebases
- Vendor coordination or approval

CAIA does not guarantee interoperability across unspecified behaviors.

---------------------------------------------------------
4. SOURCES OF AMBIGUITY
---------------------------------------------------------

Common sources of interoperability ambiguity may include:
- Optional capabilities
- Timing and ordering assumptions
- Error handling expectations
- Partial or degraded operation

This section will be expanded as real-world experience accumulates.

---------------------------------------------------------
5. RELATIONSHIP TO THE SPECIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------

This document does not override or reinterpret the CAIA specification.

Where ambiguities are identified, they may be surfaced to the
CAIA Maintainers Group (CMG) for consideration.
