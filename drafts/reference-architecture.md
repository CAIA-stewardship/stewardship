CAIA Illustrative Reference Architecture
Non-Normative Draft
=========================================================

STATUS
------
This document presents one illustrative reference architecture intended
to exercise a broad range of behaviors defined by the CAIA specification.

This document is non-normative. It does not define requirements, does not
constrain implementations, and does not bind future evolution of the
CAIA specification.

---------------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
---------------------------------------------------------

This reference architecture describes a sufficient set of system roles,
components, and usage phases to collectively exercise many core CAIA
behaviors, including enumeration, routing, timing, fault containment,
composability, and scalability.

The architecture is intended as a shared point of reference for
discussion and reasoning. It is not intended to enumerate all valid
products or implementations.

Valid CAIA-conformant systems may exist that are strict subsets or
supersets of the modules described herein, provided they do not introduce
new system semantics beyond those defined by the specification.

---------------------------------------------------------
2. ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES
---------------------------------------------------------

This illustrative architecture is guided by the following principles.
