=========================================================
CAIA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL (CSC)
Charter — Draft v0.1
=========================================================

STATUS
------
This document defines the scope, limits, and operating principles of the
CAIA Stewardship Council (CSC).

This charter is intentionally non-normative and grants no authority over
the CAIA specification.

---------------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
---------------------------------------------------------

The CAIA Stewardship Council (CSC) exists to support the adoption, correct
implementation, and long-term interoperability of systems that conform
to the CAIA specification.

CSC focuses on practical coordination and shared understanding, not
specification authorship or enforcement.

---------------------------------------------------------
2. NON-AUTHORITY OVER THE SPECIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------

CSC does NOT:
- Define, modify, interpret, or extend the CAIA specification
- Issue binding requirements or constraints
- Resolve normative disputes about CAIA behavior

The CAIA specification is governed exclusively by the
CAIA Maintainers Group (CMG).

All CSC outputs are advisory unless explicitly adopted by CMG.

---------------------------------------------------------
3. AREAS OF ACTIVITY
---------------------------------------------------------

CSC may produce non-normative materials such as:

- Interoperability guidance
- Optional certification or badging frameworks
- Reference architectures
- Best practices documents
- Example code and test harnesses
- Implementation notes and profiles

Participation in CSC programs is strictly voluntary.

---------------------------------------------------------
4. CERTIFICATION AND BADGING PRINCIPLES
---------------------------------------------------------

If CSC defines certification or badging programs, they must:

- Be optional and non-punitive
- Be scoped to interoperability, not product quality
- Avoid mandating transports, operating systems, or business models
- Permit multiple, coexisting certification profiles
- Be affordable for small builders
- Never imply CAIA conformance beyond what is already defined by CMG

Certification does not imply endorsement.

---------------------------------------------------------
5. RELATIONSHIP TO IMPLEMENTERS AND VENDORS
---------------------------------------------------------

CSC welcomes participation from individuals, companies, and other
organizations.

CSC does not act as:
- A trade association
- A lobbying body
- A marketing authority

No participant gains preferential influence by virtue of size,
funding, or market position.

---------------------------------------------------------
6. GOVERNANCE MODEL
---------------------------------------------------------

CSC operates as a lightweight working body.

Initial Formation
-----------------
- CSC may initially consist of a single convener
- This state is considered temporary and suboptimal

Expansion
---------
- Additional participants may be added openly
- No single company may control CSC decision-making
- Governance rules may be refined as participation grows

Decision-Making
---------------
- CSC prefers rough consensus
- Formal voting is avoided unless necessary
- CSC outputs must record dissent where present

---------------------------------------------------------
7. SAFEGUARDS AGAINST CAPTURE AND SCOPE CREEP
---------------------------------------------------------

CSC shall:
- Clearly label all outputs as non-normative
- Avoid creating de facto requirements
- Avoid coupling certification to commercial advantage
- Avoid entanglement with funding or sponsorship influence

Any activity that risks creating implicit authority over CAIA must
be paused and reviewed.

---------------------------------------------------------
8. FAILURE, INACTIVITY, OR DISSOLUTION
---------------------------------------------------------

If CSC becomes inactive or dissolves:
- All previously published materials remain available
- No authority reverts to CSC automatically
- CAIA specification governance is unaffected

---------------------------------------------------------
9. AMENDMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------

This charter may be amended by CSC participants.

Amendments must:
- Preserve CSC’s non-normative role
- Preserve CMG’s exclusive authority over the CAIA specification
